	<div class="introductionMain">
		<p class="bodyType"> By setting the future effects of climate change in the past, "...standing at the precipice" seeks to exploit our inaccessible relationship with the future in order to create speculate climate narratives within our past. In this way, a new relationship is formed with time, contextualizing the all encompasing concept of our global climate within a digestible scope.

		"...Standing at the Precipice" is an ongoing body of speculative design work which sets projected climate events and their effects an equidistant measure within the past in order to examine our relationship with our future. Climate events projected to take place in 2070, 50 years into the future from our present day will instead be depicted as having taken place in 1970. Those that will take place in 2040 will be depicted in the year 2000, and those in 2030 in the year 2010. In humanities timeline, we are an equal distance from the first man landing on the moon as we are from a potentially uninhabitable earth. This body of work places events within our past in order to ground them in a tangible timeline, theorizing new ways to relate to large-scale concepts, and scrutinizing humanity as a species.

	<div class="floodMain">
		<p class="bodyType"> Throughout the initial research phase of this project, a number of visual and written explorations were conducted surrounding the impact of human-caused climate change on the natural and built environment. This untitled set of compositions is the result of an exploration surrounding the depiction of global flooding at its projected peak– the total collapse of all polar ice on the planet. Data on global flood projections were paired with elevation heat maps and Google Earth satellite imagery in order to render three dimensional visualizations of 60 locations.

	<div class="hibMain">
		<p class="bodyType"> 'Hollywood is Burning' is a playable board game set in an alternate 1970's where the climate change effects of 2070 are playing out. Players take ownership of mansions in the Hollywood hills, hiring prison fire crews and private fire crews to protect their assets. The key game mechanic allows fire to spread organically and unpredictably, using die rolls to determine if tiles adjacent to already burning tiles will catch. Players use their prison and private fire crews to manage this mechanic, hoping to survive the summer with the most property assets left. If no player survives, all players lose.

	<div class="earthDayMain">
		<p class="bodyType"> ‘First Earth Day Last Earth Day’ is a fictional celebration set in 1970, honouring the beginning of our appreciation for, and subsequently end of our earth. Taking the place of the real Earth Day, first held in 1970, the piece distributed fictional screen-printed ephemera cataloguing the celebration.

	<div class="meltMain">
		<p class="bodyType"> A DAT:// website with a poem reading 'Standing at the Precipice Engulfed in a Cacophony of Silence, the Oldest Computer Halts.' is seeded to peers as it sits below a melting block of ice. As peers access the website, the initial files succumb to the drowning along with the computer it was hosted on, leaving the only remnants of the site to exist within the connection of the remaining peers. After the final computer disconnects from the site, the digital space ceases to exist entirely. This collective participation, guilt, and consequence derives from the web as a unique narrative medium.

	<div class="tshirtsMain">
		<p class="bodyType"> Set in the year 2000 and referencing early Internet aesthetics, the brand intends to explore an alternate cultural outcome as a result of the climate effects projected for the year 2040. The cultural context hypothesized is as follows: the introduction of the personal computer, Internet, and dot-com bubble (pre-burst) demonstrate incredible potential to the general public (as they did at the time), however this coincides with flooding, forest fires, and extreme weather events which will threaten the infrastructure of the Internet in the year 2040. The combination of the two ushers in an early post-post modernism in the general public, amplifying distrust for corporations as capitalism is seen as responsible for the carnage. Thrift culture and anti-capitalist messaging enters the general consciousness of young people, setting the stage for this brand to be present.

	<div class="bearMain">
		<p class="bodyType"> Framed as an object produced and given out by the Government of Canada, this speculative critical design piece intends to highlight the hypocrisy, irresponsibility and neglect the Government of Canada has employed in its purchase and expansion of the Trans Mountain Pipeline. The bear contains five soft switches which when pressed, trigger audio recordings from a speaker within the object. The five phrases are pulled directly from Government of Canada statements, and discuss how economic/ environmental growth should be weighed equally, and boast the immunity the federal Government has towards the BC Governments opposition of the pipeline. Reframing these statements in a patronizing object intends to highlight the neglect and disrespect the Government of Canada has shown towards those who oppose the pipeline as well as larger fossil fuel operations as a whole.

		<p class="bodyType">‘Parade’ is a visual exploration/audit of western demonstration/protest. All visual references and signage to the demonstration's subject matter are removed.

	</div>
	<div class="oracleMain">
		<p class="bodyType">Set in the year 2000, Oracle is a ‘Life Bond’ administering company which explores further reinvention of capital and value in a world ravaged by climate catastrophe. In response to dwindling resources, less productive crops, and further uninhabitable areas of the world the concept of ‘Life Bonds’ are offered to the general Canadian public. Participants are given payment plans either segmented or in lump sum, after entering an agreement that contractually obliges them to have their life terminated early. For example, a participant may agree not to live past 40 in order to gain enough money to purchase a nice home, another may agree to a fortune with a life cap of 25 years. By raising the short-term quality of life for individuals, they are allowed to enjoy a more fruitful but shorter life. The piece catalogues the backlash to the Millenium Environmental Protection Act, which was passed into law in the year 2000 legalizing the life bond system.

	<div class="objectsMain">
		<p class="bodyType">‘Objects’ is an ongoing series cataloguing inconsequential, minute, or colloquial outcomes of a future ravaged by climate catastrophe. The pieces present dystopic projections as mundane vignettes: Jars of sand collected from now sunken beaches, high end catalogues for exclusive conservatories, cows needle-felted wearing respiratory devices. Artifacts from an entropied future.

	</div>
	<div class="consumptionMain">
		<p class="bodyType">‘Consumption’ presents a solution for the re-invention of food waste management in the form of a self-courier smartphone application. Rather than being discarded, leftover food can be listed for sale through the application— allowing those in need to purchase and acquire the food without face-to-face interaction, for the comfort and dignity of both parties.

	<div class="ongoingMain">
		<p class="bodyType">This web-based piece is modular and ongoing, contributions will be added as they are created. </br></br>A note: The web-design of this piece intends to serve as a ‘truth-to-materials’ approach within the web as a medium. Rather than attempt to replicate facets of the physical world, this piece aims to be unmistakably web based. Images may load slowly until I can afford proper web-hosting. Background elements are draggable.
